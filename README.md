### Hello World 👋

- I am a Senior Front End Developer, but as I like to imagine myself - a 🧙 (wizard)
- I am really familiar with <img src="https://konpa.github.io/devicon/devicon.git/icons/react/react-original.svg" height="16px" width="16px"/> React, Vue and Angular
  - I have worked professionally with all of them, but I prefer React as it aligns with my views of how everything should work
  - I know how these type of frameworks are built, because I've built a couple myself ([Radi](https://radi.js.org), [Boldom](https://boldom.js.org), [Synks](https://github.com/Marcisbee/synks)) mainly as a learning experience
  - So picking up a new one like Svelte is a 🍰 (piece of cake)
- Also really familiar with Node.js, GraphQL, Marko, Deno, any css preprocessor etc. (more info at [marcisbee.com](https://marcisbee.com))
- I am learning and building stuff with Rust and Elixir in my spare time
- I started out as a back end developer writing a PHP, but I did not like it
- Soon after focused on design and front end stuff (started out when jQuery was the 💣 (bomb))
